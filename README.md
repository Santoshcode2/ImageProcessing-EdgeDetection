●	Image Processing & Edge Detection                                                               
	Developed a custom Image processing and Edge detection IP core using verilog, featuring line buffers ,multiplication & accumulation module ,and control logic for  image filtering.
	Integrated the IP into a Zynq SoC-based system via AXI interface,and validated the design through simulation and perform testing using .bmp image inputs.
	Implemented edge detection using the sobel operator by modifying the convolution logic to detect sharp pixel intensity for enhanced image clarity.
