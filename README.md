‚óèüñºÔ∏è Image Processing & Edge Detection

Developed a custom Image Processing and Edge Detection IP core using Verilog, featuring line buffers, multiplication & accumulation modules, and control logic for efficient image filtering.

Integrated the IP into a Zynq SoC-based system via the AXI interface, and validated the design through simulation and performance testing using .bmp image inputs.

Implemented edge detection using the Sobel Operator by modifying the convolution logic to detect sharp pixel intensity changes for enhanced image clarity.
